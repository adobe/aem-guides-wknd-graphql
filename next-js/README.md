# Next.js App - WKND Adventures

An example Next.js application that highlights Adobe Experience Manager's GraphQL APIs and the [AEM Headless Client for JavaScript](https://github.com/adobe/aem-headless-client-js).

This application is loosely based on the [Adobe Next.js Template](https://github.com/adobe/aem-nextjs-template/) but has been trimmed to focus on the AEM Headless GraphQL use case.
