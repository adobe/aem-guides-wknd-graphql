# AEM Guides WKND - GraphQL + SPA Editor

This branch is an augmentation of the base WKND GraphQL App to support SPA Editor (controlled, authorable zones in the SPA).

The branch's contents act as the "end state" of the AEM Headless SPA Editor tutorial when that is created/published. If this is run as-is without the supporting AEM packages from the tutorial, the authorable zones in the SPA will not render. **Don't be alarmed!**


This project includes example applications that highlights Adobe Experience Manager's GraphQL APIs and SPA Editor.

## React app
