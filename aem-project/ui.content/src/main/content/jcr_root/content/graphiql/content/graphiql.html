      This GraphiQL example depends on Promise and fetch, which are available in
      modern browsers, but can be "polyfilled" for older browsers.
      GraphiQL itself depends on React DOM.
      If you do not want to rely on a CDN, you can host these files locally or
      include them directly in your favored resource bunder.
